The data utilized in this context is sourced from SYNTHEA, a healthcare data repository. It is essential to note that the utilization of this data complies with all HIPAA regulations, as it is entirely synthetic. SYNTHEA serves as an open-source educational platform, providing fabricated patient data that closely emulates real-world hospital databases, including Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).

The primary challenge encountered during this project pertained to the organization of the data. Initially provided in a .txt format, the data required restructuring to facilitate further analysis. Part one of the project involved the meticulous cleaning and integration of four data files into SQL. Part two focuses on the creation of a final table suitable for importation into Tableau for visualization purposes.
